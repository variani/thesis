				  </div>
<p>
The thesis falls into the field of bioengineering 
and more particularly into experimental set up for chemical gas sensing.
Perhaps more than any other sensory modality,
chemical sensing faces with major technical and conceptual challenges:
low specificity, slow response time, long term instability,
power consumption, portability, coding capacity and robustness.
</p>

<p>
There is an important trend of the last decade pushing artificial olfaction to 
mimic the biological olfaction system of insects and mammalians.
The designers of machine olfaction devices take inspiration
from the biological olfactory system,
because animals effortlessly accomplish some of the unsolved scenarios in machine olfaction.
In a remarkable example of an olfactory guided behavior,
male moths navigate over large distances in order to locate calling females
by detecting pheromone signals both rapidly and robustly.
</p>

<p>
The biomimetic chemical sensing aims to 
identify the key blocks in the olfactory pathways
at all levels from the olfactory receptors to the central nervous system,
and simulate to some extent the operation of these blocks,
that would allow to approach the sensing performance known 
in biological olfactory system of animals.
New technical requirements
arise to the hardware and software equipment used in such machine olfaction experiments. 
</p>

<p>
This work explores the bioinspired approach to machine olfaction in depth on the technological side.
At the hardware level, an embedded computer is assembled,
being the core part of the experimental set up.
The embedded computer is interfaced with two main biomimetic modules designed by the collaborators:
a large-scale sensor array for emulation of the population of the olfactory receptors,
and a mobile robotic platform for autonomous experiments for guiding olfactory behavior.
At the software level, the software development kit is designed
to host the neuromorphic models of the collaborators for processing the sensory inputs as in the olfactory pathway.
</p>

<p>
Virtualization of the  set up was one of the key engineering solutions in its development. 
Being a device, the set up is transformed to a virtual system for running data simulations,
where the software environment is essentially the same,
and the real sensors are replaced by the virtual sensors 
coming from especially designed data simulation tool.
The proposed abstraction of the set up results in
an ecosystem containing both 
the virtual array for data generation
and the models of the olfactory system for data processing.
This ecosystem can be loaded from the developed system image on any personal computer.
</p>

<p>
The scientific results have been published in three journal articles, two book chapters  
and conference proceedings.
The main results on validation of the set up 
under the scenario of robotic odor localization 
are reported in the book chapters.
The series of three journal articles covers the work on the data simulation tool for machine olfaction: 
the novel model of drift, 
the models to simulate the sensor array data based on the reference data set,
and the parametrized simulated data and benchmarks proposed for the first time in machine olfaction.
</p>

<p>
This thesis ends up with a solid foundation for the research in biomimetic simulations and algorithms on machine olfaction.
The results achieved in the thesis are expected 
to give rise to new bioinspired applications in machine olfaction,
which could 
have a significant impact in the biomedical engineering research area.

Abstract: A new drift compensation method based on common principal component analysis (CPCA) is proposed. The drift variance in data is found as the principal components computed by CPCA. This method finds components that are common for all gasses in feature space. The method is compared in classification task with respect to the other approaches published where the drift direction is estimated through a principal component analysis (PCA) of a reference gas. The proposed new method – employing no specific reference gas, but information from all gases – has shown the same performance as the traditional approach with the best-fitted reference gas. Results are shown with data lasting 7 months including three gases at different concentrations for an array of 17 polymeric sensors.

Abstract: This manuscript introduces a software tool that allows for the design of synthetic experiments in machine olfaction. The proposed software package includes both, a virtual sensor array that reproduces the diversity and response of a polymer array and tools for data generation. The synthetic array of sensors allows for the generation of chemosensor data with a variety of characteristics: unlimited number of sensors, support of multicomponent gas mixtures and full parametric control of the noise in the system. The artificial sensor array is inspired from a reference database of seventeen polymeric sensors with concentration profiles for three analytes. The main features in the sensor data, like sensitivity, diversity, drift and sensor noise, are captured by a set of models under simplified assumptions. The generator of sensor signals can be used in applications related to test and benchmarking of signal processing methods, neuromorphic simulations in machine olfaction and educational tools. The software is implemented in R language and can be freely accessed at: <a href="http://chemosensors.r-forge.r-project.org/">http://chemosensors.r-forge.r-project.org/</a>.

Abstract: In machine olfaction, the design of applications based on gas sensor arrays is highly dependent on the robustness of the signal and data processing algorithms. While the practice of testing the algorithms on public benchmarks is not common in the field, we propose software for performing data simulations in the machine olfaction field by generating parameterized sensor array data. The software is implemented as an R language package chemosensors which is open-access, platform-independent and self-contained. We introduce the concept of a virtual sensor array which can be used as a data generation tool. In this work, we describe the data simulation workflow which basically consists of scenario definition, virtual array parameterization and the generation of sensor array data. We also give examples of the processing of the simulated data as proof of concept for the parameterized sensor array data: the benchmarking of classification algorithms, the evaluation of linear- and non-linear regression algorithms, and the biologically inspired processing of sensor array data. All the results presented were obtained under version 0.7.6 of the chemosensors package whose home page is <a href="chemosensors.r-forge.r-project.org">chemosensors.r-forge.r-project.org</a>.

Abstract: Liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (LC/MS) has become widely used in Metabolomics. Several artefacts have been identified during the acquisition step in large LC/MS metabolomics experiments, including ion suppression, carryover or changes in the sensitivity and intensity. Several sources have been pointed out as responsible for these effects. In this context, the drift effects of the peak intensity is one of the most frequent and may even constitute the main source of variance in the data, resulting in misleading statistical results when the samples are analysed. In this article, we propose the introduction of a methodology based on a common variance analysis before the data normalization to address this issue. This methodology was tested and compared with four other methods by calculating the Dunn and Silhouette indices of the quality control classes. The results showed that our proposed methodology performed better than any of the other four methods. As far as we know, this is the first time that this kind of approach has been applied in the metabolomics context.

          Two works, the conference proceeding and the patent proposal,
          are results of collaboration in development of an algorithm 
          for joint clustering, where the data samples come from different views or representation.
          One of the steps of the algorithm is joint diagonalization of several matrices,
          which in turn was implemented in the course of the thesis
          (R package cpca).

Abstract: The design of bioinspired systems for chemical sensing is an engaging line of research in machine olfaction. Developments in this line could increase the lifetime and sensitivity of artificial chemo-sensory systems. Such approach is based on the sensory systems known in live organisms, and the resulting developed artificial systems are targeted to reproduce the biological mechanisms to some extent. Sniffing behaviour, sampling odours actively, has been studied recently in neuroscience, and it has been suggested that the respiration frequency is an important parameter of the olfactory system, since the odour perception, especially in complex scenarios such as novel odourants exploration, depends on both the stimulus identity and the sampling method. In this work we propose a chemical sensing system based on an array of 16 metal-oxide gas sensors that we combined with an external mechanical ventilator to simulate the biological respiration cycle. The tested gas classes formed a relatively broad combination of two analytes, acetone and ethanol, in binary mixtures. Two sets of low-frequency and high-frequency features were extracted from the acquired signals to show that the high-frequency features contain information related to the gas class. In addition, such information is available at early stages of the measurement, which could make the technique suitable in early detection scenarios. The full data set is made publicly available to the community (<a href="http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Gas+sensor+array+under+flow+modulation">link</a>).
