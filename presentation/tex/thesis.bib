abstract = {The competitive sorption of 1,2-cis-dichloroethene (cis-DCE) and trichloroethene (TCE) was investigated by means of column experiments using a model porous mineral solid represented by silica gel. The experimental isotherms were obtained by employing a chromatographic method. The competitive sorption isotherms were modelled with the extended Freundlich and extended Langmuir isotherms, using the parameters from single-solute experiments. The breakthrough curves were modelled with the advection-dispersion transport equation coupled with the lumped pore diffusion model. The best results were obtained when the extended Freundlich isotherm was employed. The competitive sorption was revealed with the presence of an overshoot in the breakthrough curve of cis-DCE and a decrease in the degree of sorption of cis-DCE (20\%) and TCE (12\%). A linear dependency of the overshoot with an increase in the concentration of cis-DCE at a fixed concentration of TCE was observed, between 16\% and 20\%, and at least at concentrations <6 mg L(-1) in the liquid phase. The displaced molecules of cis-DCE by TCE were accumulated through the column causing its overshoot; thus short columns may hinder its observation. Thermodynamic analysis shows an exothermic adsorption process of -34 to -41 kJ mol(-1), which is enhanced by sorption in micropores. The Gibbs free energy is positive for cis-DCE in the multi-component case, due to its displacement by TCE.},

abstract = {A multiregion, extended Langmuir model (MREL) is proposed for predicting multicomponent adsorption equilibria. For a binary mixture, it is assumed that two regions or sites exist on the surfaces. One region or site adsorbs both species from the mixture whereas the other region or site is excluded from one species due to size exclusion or energetic exclusion (or lack of competition). On the region where both species are adsorbed, the saturated adsorption capacities are the same, and consequently the extended Langmuir model (EL) applied to this region attains thermodynamic consistency. The model is also extended to multicomponent mixtures. The total adsorbed amount of a component is the sum of that adsorbed on all regions/sites. Only the two parameters of the Langmuir isotherm for each pure component are used. The MREL model is computationally as simple as the EL model. Eight binary and one ternary systems, including some highly nonideal ones, have been tested, and significant improvements are seen with the MREL over the EL. In particular, the MREL is capable of predicting the azeotropic behavior of highly nonideal systems. Copyright 2001 Academic Press.},

abstract = {Fast, reliable and inexpensive analytical techniques for trace detection of explosive components are in high demand. Our approach is to develop specific sensor coating materials based on molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs). Despite the known inhibition of radical polymerisations by nitro groups and the known shrinkage of the polymer lattice during/after drying we were able to synthesize particulate MIPs by suspension polymerisation as well as thin MIP coatings by direct surface polymerisation on quartz crystal microbalances (QCM). The best method to purify the porous beads was Soxhlet extraction followed by supercritical carbon dioxide extraction (SFE with sc-CO2) at mild conditions (150 bar, 50 degrees C). At least a removal of >99.7\% of the template was achieved. Performance tests of TNT imprinted polymer beads showed that acrylamide (AA) and more pronounced also methacrylic acid (MAA) possessed an enhanced adsorption tendency for gaseous TNT. An adsorption of 2,4-DNT, dinitrotoluene, by these MIPs was not detected. Using 2,4-DNT as template and methacrylamide, MAAM, a positive imprint effect for gaseous 2,4-DNT was achieved with no measurable cross-sensitivity for 2,4,6-TNT. The thin MIP coatings directly synthesized on the QCMs showed thicknesses of 20 to up to 500 nm. Preliminary screening experiments were performed for five different monomers and three different solvents (acetonitrile, chloroform and dimethylformamide). Best adsorption properties for TNT vapour until now showed a PAA-MIP synthesized with chloroform. Direct measurements of the mass attachment, respectively frequency decrease of the coated QCMs during vapour treatment showed a TNT-uptake of about 150 pg per microg MIP per hour. Results look worthy for further studies.},

@article{Friedrich1997,
abstract = {Odors are thought to be represented by a distributed code across the glomerular modules in the olfactory bulb (OB). Here, we optically imaged presynaptic activity in glomerular modules of the zebrafish OB induced by a class of natural odorants (amino acids [AAs]) after labeling of primary afferents with a calcium-sensitive dye. AAs induce complex combinatorial patterns of active glomerular modules that are unique for different stimuli and concentrations. Quantitative analysis shows that defined molecular features of stimuli are correlated with activity in spatially confined groups of glomerular modules. These results provide direct evidence that identity and concentration of odorants are encoded by glomerular activity patterns and reveal a coarse chemotopic organization of the array of glomerular modules.},

@article{Goodacre1996,
abstract = {For pyrolysis mass spectrometry (PyMS) to be used for the routine identification of microorganisms, for quantifying determinands in biological and biotechnological systems, and in the production of useful mass spectral libraries, it is paramount that newly acquired spectra be compared to those previously collected. Neural network and other multivariate calibration models have been used to relate mass spectra to the biological features of interest. As commonly observed, however, mass spectral fingerprints showed a lack of long-term reproducibility, due to instrumental drift in the mass spectrometer; when identical materials were analyzed by PyMS at dates from 4 to 20 months apart, neural network models produced at earlier times could not be used to give accurate estimates of determinand concentrations or bacterial identities. Neural networks, however, can be used to correct for pyrolysis mass spectrometer instrumental drift itself, so that neural network or other multivariate calibration models created using previously collected data can be used to give accurate estimates of determinand concentration or the nature of bacteria (or, indeed, other materials) from newly acquired pyrolysis mass spectra. This approach is not limited solely to pyrolysis mass spectrometry but is generally applicable to any analytical tool which is prone to instrumental drift, such as IR, ESR, NMR and other spectroscopies, and gas and liquid chromatography, as well as other types of mass spectrometry.},

abstract = {We provide a broad review of approaches for developing chemosensor systems whose operating parameters can adapt in response to environmental changes or application needs. Adaptation may take place at the instrumentation level (e.g., tunable sensors) and at the data-analysis level (e.g., adaptive classifiers). We discuss several strategies that provide tunability at the device level: modulation of internal sensing parameters, such as frequencies and operation voltages; variation of external parameters, such as exposure times and catalysts; and development of compact microanalysis systems with multiple tuning options. At the data-analysis level, we consider adaptive filters for change, interference, and drift rejection; pattern classifiers that can adapt to changes in the statistical properties of training data; and active-sensing techniques that can tune sensing parameters in real time. We conclude with a discussion of future opportunities for adaptive sensing in wireless distributed sensor systems.},

The discussion is illustrated by case studies based on the two major approaches for uncertainty evaluation–the ISO GUM modeling approach and the Nordtest approach. This tutorial is expected to be of interest to workers in different fields of science who use measurements with amperometric sensors and need to evaluate the uncertainty of the obtained results but are new to the concept of measurement uncertainty. The tutorial is also expected to be educative in order to make measurement results more accurate.},

In either case, interaction with ambient gases is critical. It may compromise the performance of a device based on conducting polymers, whereas it is beneficial in a sensor. Conductivity has been the primary property of interest. Work function--related to conductivity, but in principle a different property--has received only scant attention.

@article{Khan2010,
abstract = {A first key step in studying a sensory modality is to define how the brain represents the features of the sensory stimulus. This has proven to be a challenge in olfaction, where even the stimulus features have been a matter of considerable debate. In this review, we focus on olfactory representations in the first stage of the olfactory pathway, the olfactory bulb (OB). We examine the diverging viewpoints on spatially organized versus distributed representations. We then consider how odor sampling through respiration is a key part of the odorant code. Finally, we ask how the bulb handles the challenging task of representing mixtures. We suggest that current evidence points toward a representation that is spatially organized at the inputs but later distributed, with the spatial organization not being used for much computation. Nevertheless, this is a simple representation that effectively represents multiple individual odorants, as well as odor mixtures.},

abstract = {The local structure and cation disorder in Y(2)Ti(2-x)Sn(x)O(7) pyrochlores, materials proposed for the encapsulation of lanthanide- and actinide-bearing radioactive waste, is studied using (119)Sn (I = 1/2) NMR spectroscopy. NMR provides an excellent probe of disorder, as it is sensitive to the atomic scale environment without the need for any long-range periodicity. However, the complex and overlapping spectral resonances that often result can be difficult to interpret. Here, we demonstrate how (119)Sn DFT calculations can be used to aid the spectral interpretation and assignment, confirming that Sn occupies only the six-coordinate pyrochlore B site, and that the Sn chemical shift is sensitive to the number of Sn/Ti on the neighbouring B sites. Although distinct resonances are resolved experimentally when the Ti content is low, there is significant spectral overlap for Ti-rich compositions. We establish that this is a result of two competing contributions to the Sn chemical shift; an upfield shift resulting from the incorporation of the more polarizing Ti(4+) cation onto the neighbouring B sites, and a concomitant downfield shift arising from the decrease in unit cell size. Despite the considerably easier spectral acquisition, the lower resolution in the (119)Sn spectra hinders the extraction of the detailed structural information previously obtained using (89)Y NMR. However, the spectra we obtain are consistent with a random distribution of Sn/Ti on the pyrochlore B sites. Finally, we consider whether an equilibrium structure has been achieved by investigating materials that have been annealed for different durations.},

abstract = {Abstract 10.1002/cem.1180060208.abs Traditionally, one form of preprocessing in multivariate calibration methods such as principal component regression and partial least squares is mean centering the independent variables (responses) and the dependent variables (concentrations). However, upon examination of the statistical issue of error propagation in multivariate calibration, it was found that mean centering is not advised for some data structures. In this paper it is shown that for response data which (i) vary linearly with concentration, (ii) have no baseline (when there is a component with a non-zero response that does not change in concentration) and (iii) have no closure in the concentrations (for each sample the concentrations of all components add to a constant, e.g. 100\%) it is better not to mean center the calibration data. That is, the prediction errors as evaluated by a root mean square error statistic will be smaller for a model made with the raw data than a model made with mean-centered data. With simulated data relative improvements ranging from 1\% to 13\% were observed depending on the amount of error in the calibration concentrations and responses.},

abstract = {We introduce a new general framework for the recognition of complex visual scenes, which is motivated by biology: We describe a hierarchical system that closely follows the organization of visual cortex and builds an increasingly complex and invariant feature representation by alternating between a template matching and a maximum pooling operation. We demonstrate the strength of the approach on a range of recognition tasks: From invariant single object recognition in clutter to multiclass categorization problems and complex scene understanding tasks that rely on the recognition of both shape-based as well as texture-based objects. Given the biological constraints that the system had to satisfy, the approach performs surprisingly well: It has the capability of learning from only a few training examples and competes with state-of-the-art systems. We also discuss the existence of a universal, redundant dictionary of features that could handle the recognition of most object categories. In addition to its relevance for computer vision, the success of this approach suggests a plausibility proof for a class of feedforward models of object recognition in cortex.},

A number of different methods, based on different principles, have been developed in the past for the detection of explosives. Sensors are one of those methods of detection which have capability to mimic the canine system and which are known to be the most reliable method of detection. The objective of this review is to provide comprehensive knowledge and information on the sensors operating on different transduction principles, ranging from electrochemical to immunosensors, being used for the detection of explosives as they pose a threat for both health and security of the nation. The review focuses mainly on the sensors developed in the recent 5 years and is prepared through summary of literature available on the subject.},

abstract = {The research and development of new electronic-nose applications in the biomedical field has accelerated at a phenomenal rate over the past 25 years. Many innovative e-nose technologies have provided solutions and applications to a wide variety of complex biomedical and healthcare problems. The purposes of this review are to present a comprehensive analysis of past and recent biomedical research findings and developments of electronic-nose sensor technologies, and to identify current and future potential e-nose applications that will continue to advance the effectiveness and efficiency of biomedical treatments and healthcare services for many years. An abundance of electronic-nose applications has been developed for a variety of healthcare sectors including diagnostics, immunology, pathology, patient recovery, pharmacology, physical therapy, physiology, preventative medicine, remote healthcare, and wound and graft healing. Specific biomedical e-nose applications range from uses in biochemical testing, blood-compatibility evaluations, disease diagnoses, and drug delivery to monitoring of metabolic levels, organ dysfunctions, and patient conditions through telemedicine. This paper summarizes the major electronic-nose technologies developed for healthcare and biomedical applications since the late 1980s when electronic aroma detection technologies were first recognized to be potentially useful in providing effective solutions to problems in the healthcare industry.},
